Industry Visit Reflection
-
During our industrial visit, we learned about Data Engineering and its critical role in managing modern systems. Key components include Data Architecture, which involves users, system designers, developers, and data custodians. We explored databases like MySQL and Oracle RAC 19C, understanding how data admins and engineers collaborate to handle large-scale systems. The speaker emphasized the importance of data in decision-making, stating that data relevance will continue for the next 10 to 20 years. Excitingly, they also mentioned implementing WiFi 6 next year to enhance connectivity and infrastructure.
There are different roles in a data architecture system, the first one is user like the student and staff, and next up we have system designers and system developers which are responsible for the presenting the app and developing the application. After that we have data owner, they are responsible for the accuracy and quality of data, and lastly we have data custodian and data engineer who helps to create system to collect, manage, and transform data into usable information.

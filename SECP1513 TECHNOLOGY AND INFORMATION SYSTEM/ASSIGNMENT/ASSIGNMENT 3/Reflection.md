Academic Writing Reflection
-
 The significance of both technical and soft skills has been reflected upon through attending the talk
 and reading the articles, highlighting their importance in real-world scenarios. In software
 development teams, for instance, the creation of high-quality code is ensured by technical skills, but
 soft skills such as collaboration and communication are the ones that smoothen the execution of
 projects and align with user expectations. Without strong interpersonal skills, the full potential of
 technical solutions may fail to be achieved. This analysis has led to the re-evaluation of my own skill
 set. While the improvement of technical skills has always been prioritized, the cultivation of soft
 skills has now been recognized as equally important. To address this, opportunities to develop both
 areas will be actively sought, whether through internships, course assignments, or workshops. By
 doing so, a well-rounded computer science student capable of overcoming dynamic challenges can
 be developed.
